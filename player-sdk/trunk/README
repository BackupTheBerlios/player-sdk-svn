Player.Sdk is a framework to easy the development of new Music players. I has a common
set of features used by most of the players around, such as playlist management, music database,
playing capabilities and so on.

One of the Player.Sdk goals is to build music player GUIs on top of it. Another goal is portability,
so OS specific code can be replaced easily (drag'n drop). You won't find platform specefic code inside
the framework. All the Framework code is fully managed.

Flexibility is another goal of the framework, so a plugin architecture to add new features has been
developed. This will keep the core of the framework clean and small.

Player.Sdk Core Features:
* Drag'n drop player backend support.
* Drag'n drop database backend support.
* Playlist support.
* Configuration support.
* Plug-ins support.
* Fully managed.
