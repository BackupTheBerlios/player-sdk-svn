Plugin Architecture
--------------------
* Add support for a plugin arch. Plugins should be able to be
loaded and unloaded from user dir or system wide.
* Plugins have access to the sdk services.
* Some example plugins:
	- Exporting playlist as a webservice.
	- DBus support
	- Playlist export


DataKits
---------
* SqliteDataKit is not finished yet.

Add more DataKits
--------------
* iPod data kit

Kits improvements
------------------
* Add support for changing the kits on the fly, once the Player.Sdk has been
started. This will allow us to swap the db backends from sqlite to ipoddb if the
user wants to manage the ipod database.
